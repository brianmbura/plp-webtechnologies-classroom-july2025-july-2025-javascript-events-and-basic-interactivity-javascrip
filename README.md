## 🎯 Features

### 1. JavaScript Event Handling
- **View More button** toggles extra car details (price, fuel type, transmission).
- **Hover/Click interactions** highlight important sections.

### 2. Interactive Elements
- **Dark/Light mode toggle** for user customization.
- **FAQ section** with collapsible answers for common rental questions.
- **Dynamic total price calculation** (daily rate × number of days).

### 3. Form Validation
A custom **Booking Form** that validates:
- ✅ **Name** (at least 3 characters)  
- ✅ **Email** (valid email format via regex)  
- ✅ **Phone** (Kenyan format: `07XXXXXXXX` or `+2547XXXXXXXX`)  
- ✅ **Car selection** (must choose a car)  
- ✅ **Rental dates** (end date must be after start date)  

If all inputs are valid → a **success message** is shown.  
If not → specific **error messages** are displayed below each field.
